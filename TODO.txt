- changing zelda's (q = 1 % 32) timeSig seems to do nothing
    -  play $ withMetronome (14,8) $ changeTimeSig (12,8) (14,8) $ quantize (1 % 8) (cut 12 zelda)
        - this works, but quantize at (1 % 16) and it doesn't
- make things more efficient
- map function for MusicD to manipulate all the leaf notes.
