- CLI program
    [X] version
    - SoundFont
        [X] clean
            - remove unused samples/instruments
        [X] merge
        [X] show
            [X] print header, number of samples/insts/presets
            [X] list preset name/bank/preset with index
            [ ] list instrument names (with indices)?
        [ ] filter-instruments (optional)
        [X] filter-presets
        [X] modify-header
            - update header info
        [X] retune
            - take in single tuning, alter all instruments to this tuning
        [X] retune-split
            [X] take in multiple tunings (JSON or multiple .tun files)
            [X] split into separate files (one instrument each), all tunings
    - MIDI
        [X] retune
            - input: TUN & MIDI, output: MIDI
                - Option 1: make it playable with standard SoundFont but in new tuning, via altering pitches & PitchWheel
                - Option 2: change notes to their counterpart in TUN file with smallest pitch difference (intended to be played with the TUN-adjusted SoundFont)
        [ ] transpose (uniform retune)
        [ ] change-timesig
        [ ] change-tempo
            - take factor OR BPM OR word (e.g. adagio)
            - if BPM based, need to know ticks per beat & ticks per sec (stored in MIDI)
        [ ] tag
            - prepend global metadata (timesig, keysig, text, copyright, track name, text)
    - convert
        - LilyPond <-> MIDI
            - unit tests (quickcheck)
                - toMidi . toLil = id
                - toLil . toMidi . toLil = toLil
        - MIDI + SoundFont -> WAV/MP3
            - call fluidsynth
            - fluidsynth  "GT Steel.sf2" -F "high-hopes.wav" high-hopes.mid
        - MIDI & Lilypond <-> MusicXML (.mscx)
    - play
        [X] play MIDI
        [ ] play LilyPond
        [ ] direct input MIDI to the opened fluidsynth port?
        [ ] Why is --help duplicated??


- make things more efficient (esp. MusicD)
- map function for MusicD to manipulate all the leaf notes.
