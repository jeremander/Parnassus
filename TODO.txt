TODO
----
- reintroduce overloaded pitch literals (separate Pitched into FromPitch/ToPitch)
- Use Euterpea pitches/modes in Lilypond section (remove Music.Pitch.Literal / Music.Dynamic.Literal)
- move tests into their own modules
- generalized stochastic DFS (if limit to one sample, can get stuck)
- simulated annealing
- generation order
- make things more efficient (esp. MusicD)
- map function for MusicD to manipulate all the leaf notes.
