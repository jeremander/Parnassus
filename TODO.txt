TODO
----
- NB: play causes superclass's toMusic to be called!
- debug: play $ toMusicD $ removeTempos mm3
- map function for MusicD to manipulate all the leaf notes.
- arbitrary requantization of MusicD (use groupWith to requantize time intervals)
- ensure tempos work properly when converting (e.g. toMusicD doesn't accurately capture tempo changes for mm3) and quantizing
    - controlD $ toMusicD $ mm3 doesn't undistribute the tempo because it's on the inside
